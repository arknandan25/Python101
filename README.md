### Ok tested
* Link for Core material for Python: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

### How to run your code?
Run code on Pycharm via Control + R (^R)
Edit/Re-format option + Enter
-OR-
Pro methods:
Use a python shebang in your code:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

Then make that file executable
chmod 755 my_python_file.py

Execute your code without invoking the default python interpreter
./my_python_file.py
```

### Highlights of this repo (Under development)
Some basics yet important concepts, also to be included in the Python for Pros docs:
* [What does it mean that Python is a scripting language?](https://www.javatpoint.com/is-python-scripting-language#:~:text=The%20scripting%20language%20is%20referred,instead%20of%20a%20compiled%20language.)
* Idioms of Python
* The Zen of Python
* The Python Interpreter and how to mess with it?
* How does importing works in python? Understand the dunder methods in play when you import files
* How does multithreading work in Python? [Not super important but good topic to know]

### TBD
* Flask API implementation
  * REST
  * SOAP
* Django Implementation for a web app
* Design a Web app with backend API and a front end using a modern framework
  * Ideally based on containers i.e develop a microservice
* Jinja [Upcoming]
* Using YAML with python [Upcoming]
* Subprocesses -> mixing Python with bash [Upcoming]
* DSA based codes [Upcoming]
  * LRU cache
* Complex Python - Custom Context Managers [Maybe]
