"""
DI/D: Dependency Inversion (D in SOLID)

Key part of DI:
Abstraction: Separate definition of interface from its implementation
Types


Python has no abstraction mechanism, also has no types
ABC(Abstract base Class) allows us to implement abstraction
Type hints allows us to specify types of parameters, return types of functions
meant for readability, interpreter does not do any actual type checking:: mypy is used for type checking
